# Clustering-Grizzer-

Intermezzo:
Grizzer is a wild animal hunting organization that is in Indonesia. They also want to prove myths about grizzly bears, because some people argue that grizzly bears are brown in fur, while some people argue that it is not. Due to that, they decided that they want to make a clustering model that will have 2 cluster, grizzly bear cluster and non-grizzly bear cluster. 
Details for BearTesting.csv and BearTraining.csv have been uploaded in PNG format.
